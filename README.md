# BGmodel

This is the underlying code for a shiny app exploring some principles of ecological modelling.
The app is hosted at https://hmetcalfe1.shinyapps.io/BGmodel/

The app uses a real-world exapmple of a problematic agricultural weed and how we might model its growth year-on-year. 
The data used in the examples are simulated data and are not derived from experiments.

The app is aimed at 16-18 year olds interested in pursuing a career in applied mathematics and can be used as a stand alone tool or as a teaching aid in a classromm setting.
